Admin panel improvements and date format standardization

- Fixed high water mark default (0 → 1) to prevent NNTP timeout errors
- Removed 20+ duplicate pause() calls after error messages
- Improved log viewer: better navigation, limited to data/logs/, cleaner display
- Standardized date/time format across all PyGate components (DD-Mon-YY HH:MM:SS)
- Changed filter manager exit option (3 → Q) for consistency

Files modified:
- admin_panel.py: High water mark, duplicate pause fixes, log viewer improvements
- src/filter_manager.py: Exit option consistency
- bin/gate.sh: Date format standardization
